    <title>Interactive, Visual Uncertainty Quantification for Encrypted Network Traffic Situation Awareness</title>
    <meta name="description" content="As machine learning-based applications reach the hands of operators, the models often struggle to communicate the confidence of their predictions. Operators may end up blindly trusting a model, unaware that the model is only marginally confident or has never seen the input data during training. We present a visualization dashboard for encrypted network traffic labels that combines confidence sliders and visualizations to contextualize the model’s uncertainty."/>
