00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
As machine learning-based applications reach the hands of operators, 

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:07,299
the models often struggle to communicate the confidence of their predictions.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,999
Operators may end up blindly trusting a model,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,599
unaware that the model is only marginally confident 

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,599
or has never seen the input data during training.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,599
We present a visualization dashboard for encrypted network traffic labels 

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,999
that combines confidence sliders and visualizations

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to contextualize the modelâ€™s uncertainty.
